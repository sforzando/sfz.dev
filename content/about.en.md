## Message from CEO

{{< figure src="img/teams/ceo.png" class="m-4 max-w-xs float-right" alt="Shin`ichiro Suzuki" caption="Photo by [niacari](https://niacari.jp)" >}}

Hello, I am [Shin'ichiro Suzuki](/teams/shin-sforzando), the CEO of sforzando group.

Our customers often tell us, "sfz has a unique culture."
It is true that in most cases, we have not been able to deliver exactly what they originally requested.

Through discussion and trial and error, we may realize the possibility of making it faster, cheaper, safer, and better.
Then, we do not hesitate to share new possibilities and reopen the discussion with our customers about **how this project should be**.
We believe this is what really matters to our customers and how we contribute to the world.

We are grateful that so many people understand and support our business and culture.
Therefore, we will continue to work diligently so that our customers will be happy to say, "Yes, this is what I wanted to do!"
