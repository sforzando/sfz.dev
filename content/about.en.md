## Message from CEO

{{< figure src="img/teams/ceo.png" class="m-4 max-w-xs float-right" alt="Shin'ichiro Suzuki" caption="Photo by [niacari](https://niacari.jp)" >}}

Hello, I'm [Shin'ichiro Suzuki](/teams/shin-sforzando), the CEO of sforzando group.

Our customers often tell us that "sfz has a unique culture."
It is true that in most cases, we have not been able to deliver exactly what they originally requested.

Through discussion and trial and error, we may realize that we can do it faster, cheaper, safer, and better.
Then, we do not hesitate to share new possibilities and reopen the discussion with our customers about **how this project should be done**.
We believe this is what really matters to our customers and how we contribute to the world.

We are grateful that so many people understand and support our business and culture.
As a result, we will continue to work diligently to make sure our customers can say, "Yes, this is what We wanted to do!"
