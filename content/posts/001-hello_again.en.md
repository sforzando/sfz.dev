We are about to complete our 5th fiscal year.  
Including the time of free-lancer "szk-engineering", we have counted 92 projects that we have been involved in over the past 8 years.

On average, we have worked on 11.5 new projects each year.  
These ambitious projects have kept us inspired and motivated.  
These details will be written about in other articles.  
Anyway, we would like to thank all of our clients who keep us going in the face of COVID-19 Disaster.

On August 14, 2018, SFORZANDO TECHNOLOGIES INC. was registered in BC, Canada.  
We have outside members such as accountants, lawyers, and laborers who support our group in Japan and Canada respectively.  
They are all kind people who generously support our companies.  
We would like to take this opportunity to thank them.

To be honest, the old website did not provide much information.  
We would like to provide information more frequently and casually on this new website.

We are looking forward to our future business dealings in the days ahead.
