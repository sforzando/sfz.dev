We apologize for the unexpected redirect from `sforzando.co.jp` or `szk-engineering` to here.

We are announcing that our Japanese headquarters, **sforzando LLC.** has merged its domain with that of our Canadian subsidiary, **SFORZANDO TECHNOLOGIES INC.**

Accordingly, the email address `... @sforzando.co.jp` has been changed to `... @sfz.dev` .  
(Members of the Japanese headquarters use both `... @sforzando.co.jp` and `... @sfz.dev`).

We apologize for any inconvenience caused by this change.
